Inventory Management Optimization is a Python tool designed to help businesses efficiently manage their stock levels. This script analyzes historical sales data, forecasts future demand, and provides recommendations for optimal inventory levels to reduce costs while avoiding stockouts.

Features

Demand Forecasting: Uses historical sales data to predict future demand using statistical or machine learning models.

Stock Level Optimization: Suggests optimal reorder points and order quantities based on predicted demand and lead times.

Inventory Alerts: Identifies items that are overstocked or understocked and generates actionable alerts.

Cost Analysis: Calculates holding costs, shortage costs, and total inventory costs to help improve decision-making.

Visualization: Provides graphs and charts to visualize trends, stock levels, and forecasts.

Requirements

Before running the script, you need to install the following Python dependencies:

pandas: For data handling and manipulation.

numpy: For numerical computations.

matplotlib or seaborn: For data visualization.

scikit-learn (optional): For machine learning-based forecasting.

statsmodels (optional): For statistical time series forecasting models.

You can install these dependencies using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels
